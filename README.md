# Greetr_library
Mini library that helps give greetings on the website when the user logs in. 
Supports 3 different languages.

When given a first name, last name and an optional language, it 
generates formal and informal greetings that can be used throughout the app or a website.
It supports English, Spanish and Ukrainian languages.


Easy to type structure, kind of jQuery like, G$().

Supports jQuery.
Even though it returns greetings, it's possible to give it a jQuery
object that points at some HTML element. And it'll fill that element with the greeting.
